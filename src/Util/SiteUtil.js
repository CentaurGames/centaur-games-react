      "Distinguished archaeologist Jack Logan has finally done it - after years of tireless searching, he has finally uncovered the tomb of the sun-god Ra. Unbeknownst to him, the tomb is an entrance to a much more sinister place: the Duat, the underworld of Ancient Egypt. To escape, he must venture through its twelve deadly chambers and defeat the enemies of Ra. But beware...only the most intrepid souls will escape the torments of the Duat. \nInstructions: Lure the monsters into the traps, but avoid falling into the traps yourself. Blue ankhs will give you extra lives, and the red embers dropped by the sun god will help brighten your torch. (You lose all red embers every time you die.) Once each level is clear of monsters, pass through the pyramid to proceed to the next level. \nControls: Desktop: Use the arrow keys to move around. Touchscreen: Tap a tile to move towards it. The character will automatically avoid obstacles and traps, but it is your job to keep him safe from the monsters! \nThe background music in this game is Firesong by Kevin MacLeod, which is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n Source: https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100598\n Artist: http://incompetech.com/ \nAdditional sound effects obtained from https://www.zapsplat.com.",

      "Try your luck against Grumpy Joe - he may give you a run for your money! Looking for a more challenging opponent? Try Pool Champions in the link below.\nInstructions: Strike the cue ball to hit the other balls into the pockets. The stripes player must sink all the stripes, and the solids player must sink all the solids. If you sink the eight ball before your balls are cleared, you lose the game - if you sink it after your balls are cleared, you win. (Stripes and solids are determined by the first ball to be sunk into a pocket, and the first player to sink it.)\nControls: Once the cue appears, tap and hold or click and hold in the direction you would like to hit the ball. The longer you press, the harder the cue will strike. (The cue will only appear on the screen when all of the balls have stopped moving.)\nNote: Works best on desktop - though compatible with modern mobile devices, the game will lag a little due to the 3d graphics.",
